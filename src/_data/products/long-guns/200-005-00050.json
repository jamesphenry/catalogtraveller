  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->Modified version of the disposable accelerator carbine.<!-- Summary End --> The weapon fires a projectile at a low initial velocity; after it leaves the barrel, an internal charge accelerates the bullet to greater velocities. Accelerator weapons have low recoil and are well adapted to zero-G environments. The carbine version of the weapon is shorter and lighter than its rifle counterpart. This version is constructed of relatively inexpensive materials and has a working lifetime measured in days.</p>",
