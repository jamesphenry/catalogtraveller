  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The Dover-Gabe Courier Robot was a TL-11 specialized courier robot, built to quickly transport communications material from one location to another.<!-- Summary End --> It is a custom 30-ton pod hull, controlled by a semi-organic brain (83R = INT 8, EDU 3, Charisma R) with a set of small craft skill programs (Pilot-4, Comms-2, Sensop-2). As with all brain-based systems, each brain has one skill level in a hobby (randomly determined). Compensation given to brain-based systems varies, but is often non-monetary. These particular models have room for one or two additional levels of skill; upgrades are often sufficiently motivating for these systems.</p><p>The onboard fuel cell provides power for 10 weeks (5 weeks in an un-oxygenated atmosphere). It includes a surface-mount comms array and a Distant-ranged proximeter for collision avoidance.</p>",
