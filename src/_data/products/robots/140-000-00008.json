This a gravity-suspended robot which relied on small ducted fans for maneuverability. It has several magnetic arms which can extend from the chassis to grip walls and secure the robot's position. The ducted fans do not have enough power to overcome an average human's strength. This robot is powered by internal batteries which require recharging approximately every four days.</p><p><h5>History & Background</h5>The Ling-Standard Products <strong>Police Robot Model 317 (PR-317)</strong> was a widespread security robot in the Diaspora sector before the Collapse.
