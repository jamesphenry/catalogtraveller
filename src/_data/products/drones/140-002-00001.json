  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The Extra eye microdrone is a small, cheap, disposable sensor drone used for system survey work.<!-- Summary End --> The drone is a cylinder 320mm long and 57mm in diameter. The core of the drone is a broad spectrum EM sensor with coverage from long range radio to the far ultraviolet. A small computer does basic sensor analysis and navigation. There is a small, very low powered thruster for maneuvering. The primary design (called the S variant) uses a folding solar cell and 1 MWs battery cell to power the drone. The limitations of the solar cell power generation limit its use to the life zone of a system. The S variant has a 0.005G thruster, driving the drone over 1AU in a little over 40 days, and 10 AU in 128 days.</p>",
