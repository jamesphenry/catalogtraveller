  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The Extra eye microdrone is a small, cheap, disposable sensor drone used for system survey work.<!-- Summary End --> The drone is a cylinder 320mm long and 57mm in diameter. The core of the drone is a broad spectrum EM sensor with coverage from long range radio to the far ultraviolet. A small computer does basic sensor analysis and navigation. There is a small, very low powered thruster for maneuvering.</p><p>The outer system design (the R variant) uses an 14 watt short duration radiothermal generator for power. A slightly larger 0.022G thruster drives the drone over 1AU (150m km) in a little over 19 days, and 10 AU in 61 days.</p>",
