  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The passive infrared cybernetic eye is extremely sensitive to infrared radiation (ANI visual bands) and can \"see\" heat.<!-- Summary End --> Smoke, blown sand, and any sort of atmospheric conditions will interfere with eyes. They have a short range of 100 meters. This version of the cybernetic eye is single-function eye and looks more like a natural, unaltered eye.</p><p> In all cases, the cyber eye also includes basic visible light vision. For Sophonts with different visual ranges the basic cyber eye will cover their normal visual range.</p>",
