  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->Cybernetic Lungs are paired battery-powered devices that function as a powerful oxygen / carbon dioxide cycling system.<!-- Summary End --> These are connected to the circulatory system, replacing the natural lungs. The internal battery is extremely compact and has a long life, typically measured in decades.</p><p>Cybernetic lungs can be fitted with an integral Filter / Respirator which allow breathing of tainted atmosphere without harmful effects. Early versions rely on extensive pre-lung filters, typically installed within the nasal cavity: individuals with this version must blow their noses regularly to clear the filters.</p>",
