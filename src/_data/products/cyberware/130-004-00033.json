  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The rangefinder projects a low-energy infrared laser beam and determines range from the reflection.<!-- Summary End --> The rangefinder eye is accurate within 1% of range out to 5 kilometers. Smoke, blown sand, and any sort of atmospheric conditions will interfere with eyes. They have a short range of 100 meters. This version of the cybernetic eye looks more like a natural, unaltered eye.</p><p> In all cases, the cyber eye also includes basic visible light vision. For Sophonts with different visual ranges the basic cyber eye will cover their normal visual range.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The rangefinder cybernetic eye requires the eyeball display to be installed.</p>",
