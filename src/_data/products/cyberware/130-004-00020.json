  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->Grav Caps are cybernetics incorporating gravitic lifters designed to help amputees.<!-- Summary End --> The device is generally two caps that fit over the ends of amputated legs allowing a contragrav field to mitigate the consequences of having a lost limb. The devices can be designed with a wide variety of technological capabilities including cyberware aspects. Some versions not only allow practical ped ambulation, but also enable grav-assisted flight.</p><p>The technology doesn't really mature until TLâ€“14. Prototypes are available at earlier TL's, but have technological limitations. Limb regeneration technologies also tend to mature in this period undercutting the market success of this device.</p>",
