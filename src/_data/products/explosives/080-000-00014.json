  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->A small coin sized charge of Thermite, designed to open locks by burning them into uselessness.<!-- Summary End --> Thin enough to slide between a door and the jam to cut the locking bolt, or simply attached to the lock itself. Ignition is a simple press of a button on the side, and equipped with a safety to prevent accidental discharge. Counts as an explosive device and restricted or banned on most worlds.</p>",
