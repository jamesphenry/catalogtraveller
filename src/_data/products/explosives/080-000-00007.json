  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->Linear Burning Rope is an explosive device used to cut through metal surfaces, being capable of cutting through a ship's hull.<!-- Summary End --> Each rope is packaged in 8-meter long coils, with a rope diameter of 3cm; within the vacuum-sealed plastic packs they are further wrapped in a cellophane-like red and yellow-striped covering, which peels off to reveal a bright yellow putty-like substance, akin to plastic explosives. Each package also contains two piezoelectric initiator plugs.</p><p>The manufacturer of the rope recommends in the literature that an insulating blanket of some kind be affixed to affected surfaces to prevent burn injuries after penetration (they recommend a product they manufacture, as it happens).</p>",
