  "description": "<!-- Summary Start -->The #1 Power Cell is a 1cm x 5mm x 5mm slab that can power a Size 2 device.<!-- Summary End --> The PowerCell is a storage battery for operating devices independently. Typically, a PowerCell is one size smaller than the device it powers, lasts for 24 hours (or about-a-day) of continual use, and has negligible discharge during non-use. Cells support micro-induction power transfer, and are capable of powering items without direct connections. The quality of the cell determines its operational life.</p>",
