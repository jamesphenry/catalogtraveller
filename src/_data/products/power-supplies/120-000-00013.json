  "description": "<!-- Summary Start -->The #2 Power Cell is a 9cm x 4mm x 4mm cylinder that can power a Size 3 device.<!-- Summary End --> The PowerCell is a storage battery for operating devices independently. Typically, a PowerCell is one size smaller than the device it powers, lasts for 24 hours (or about-a-day) of continual use, and has negligible discharge during non-use. Cells support micro-induction power transfer, and are capable of powering items without direct connections. The quality of the cell determines its operational life.</p>",
