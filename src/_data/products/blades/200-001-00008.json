  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The largest of the sword weapons, also called the two-handed sword because it requires both hands to swing.<!-- Summary End --> The blade is extremely heavy, two-edged, and about  1000 to 1200mm in length. The hilt is relatively simple, generally a crosspiece only, with little basketwork or  protection. When carried, the broadsword is worn in a scabbard attached to the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is worn on the back, and the broadsword is drawn over the shoulder.</p>",
