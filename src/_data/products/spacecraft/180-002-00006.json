  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The Type GE is a minor naval vessel deployed in a defensive role; the ship favors gun weaponry (primarily plasma or fusion guns).<!-- Summary End --></p><p>The ship has three modes of operation:<ul><li><strong>Standard with Drop Tanks (400 tons):</strong> Jump Drive H in 400-ton hull produces Jump-4. Maneuver Drive H = 4G.</li><li><strong>Without Drop Tanks (300 tons):</strong> Although Jump Drive-H in a 300-ton hull can produce Jump-5, in-hull fuel tankage restricts the drive effect to Jump-2 (based on 60 tons of fuel). Maneuver Drive-H = 5G.</li><li><strong>Special (300 tons after dropping tanks):</strong> The ship with Drop Tanks and Transfer Pump can process 150 tons of fuel to support Jump-5, with the Drop Tanks shed before Jump initiates.</li></ul></p><p>The 100-ton Drop Tank can support one HardPoint and associated weapon.</p>",
