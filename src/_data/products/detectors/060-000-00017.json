  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start --> The neutrino detector measures the level of neutrinos in a given direction.<!-- Summary End --> Neutrinos primarily occur as the byproduct of fusion reactions, so positive readings may reflect the presence of fusion reactors or nuclear activity. Because neutrinos are almost impossible to shield, Neutrino Detectors are effective in sensing ships through their Power Plants (although not APlants or Collectors). They can also detect Fusion+ modules. Ships can frustrate Neutrino Detectors by turning off the Power Plant.</p>",
