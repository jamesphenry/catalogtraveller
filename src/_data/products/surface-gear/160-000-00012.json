  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->50 meter length of fine flexible plasteel cable, capable of supporting kup to 250 kilograms.<!-- Summary End --> Rope is a versatile tool that has no real replacement even at higher tech levels. It is the single most important element of a climber's equipment; it can be used to bind prisoners; it can add safety to water or ravine crossings. A variety of types and sizes are available; in general, however, they are all similar in reliability and price within any given tech level.</p>",
