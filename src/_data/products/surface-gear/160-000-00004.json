  "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->A three-pronged grapnel.<!-- Summary End --> A grapnel is a hook at the end of a line, which is used for attempting climbs up sheer pitches. Maximum range to throw a grapnel is about 30 meters, thus, seven separate climbs would complete a 200 meter pitch (planting the grapnel on a ledge or projection, climbing to it, then repeating). Grapnel climbing bypasses the procedure of sending up a lead climber; each climb is equivalent to a regular climb up emplaced ropes.</p>",
