## Searching the Central Supply Catalog

The search feature allows the user to enter one or more keywords and the catalog will attempt to find any matches. If there are matches, the search results will be listed in the order of the match score for the term(s). For example, if you enter the terms _laser pistol_, you will see that the products with both terms are listed first, followed by any products that match any other subset of the terms. The search currently searches the name and the description for matches.

Work is underway to enhance the sophistication of the search to all for groupings of terms with _and_, _or_, and _not_.
